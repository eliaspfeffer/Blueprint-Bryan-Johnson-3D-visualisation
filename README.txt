Goal:

Have a 3D rendering of a human body and its organs with the organs marked in colors (green = age 18, dark red = age 120).
Have as many datapoints being added and synced (best common ground I guess would be apple health) automatically.

Daily sensors to implement:
- smart weight sensor
- blood panel results (reference points: insightview blood panel datapoints)
- skin sensors?
- whoop or apple watch athletic indexes.
- get apple health
