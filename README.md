=== Blueprint Bryan Johnson 3D Visualization ===

Goal: have a visualisation of how old your individual organs are, by only looking at the data.

1. Have a 3D rendering of a human body and its organs with the organs marked in colors (green = age 18, dark red = age 120).
Something similar to this: https://www.zygotebody.com/#nav=7.83,82.56,287.28,0,0,0,0&sel=p:;h:;s:;c:0;o:0&layers=0,1,3069
... but marked in colours depending on individual age.

2. Have as many datapoints automatically being added and synced and interpreted as possible (best API-reference-point for all sensors would be apple health, I guess).

Daily sensors to implement:

- smart weight sensor
- blood panel results (reference points: insightview blood panel datapoints)
- skin sensors?
- whoop or apple watch athletic indexes.
- get all data at once from apple health
